                    <p>I am a junior at the <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/uc-berkeley-and-four-other-schools-removed-from-best-colleges-list-for-misreporting-statistics/" target="_blank">University of California, Berkeley</a> (üêª <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOAvRb-AJg" target="_blank">go bears!</a> üêª) studying computer science. I currently teach CS61A, the introductory computer science course at Cal, as an <a href="https://cs61a.org/TAs.html" target="_blank">undergraduate student instructor</a> (no, my tuition is not fully reimbursed sadly).

                    <p>I love <a href="https://www.coursera.org" target="_blank">education technology</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_lists_of_lists" target="_blank"> actively contributing to Wikipedia</a>, and absorbing as much information as is humanly possible.

My music tastes are probably more obscure than yours. In fact, my music tastes are <a href="https://obscurifymusic.com" target="_blank">90% more obscure than the average Spotify user</a>. Let me know if you beat this or would like to give/receive music <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PdwvtKyNnY">recommendations</a>. And to answer your question: <a href="https://forebears.io/surnames/cherfaoui">My parents are originally from Algeria</a>, a country in North Africa, hence the unique spelling of Samy and the last name. If you're curious as to why I don't look like a typical North African, here's a shameless plug for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabyle_people" target="_blank">my people</a>.</p>

                    <h2>What I Do</h2>
                    <hr>

                    <h3>Undergraduate Student Instructor, <a href="https://cs61a.org/" target="_blank">CS61A</a></h3>
                    <p>Will be teaching the introductory computer science class at UC Berkeley (also, the largest class on campus with 2000+ enrolled) starting Fall 2019. Responsibilities include teaching lab and discussion, writing and grading exams, crafting resources and guides, hosting office hours, assisting with course software development, and managing course logistics.</p>
                    </br>

                    <h3>Undergraduate Student Researcher, <a href="https://hackingmaterials.lbl.gov/index.html#TEAM">Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory</a></h3>
                    <p> I worked under Dr. Anubhav Jain and Alexander Dunn on the automatminer project, an automated prediction engine for material properties (more details published under What I've Done) with the <a href="https://hackingmaterials.lbl.gov/index.html#TEAM" target="_blank">Hacking Materials resourch group</a>. I designed, implemented, and tuned a neural network regression wrapper for Sci-Kit Learn using Keras to improve cross validation accuracy. I also developed an algorithm to optimize neural network architectures using genetic algorithms. Results are set to be published soon in <i>Nature Communications</i>.</p>
                    <p>You can view Hacking Materials' open source repositories <a href="https://github.com/hackingmaterials" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
                </br>

                    <h3>Senior Mentor, <a href="https://csmentors.berkeley.edu/#/bios/cs61a">Computer Science Mentors</a></h3>
                    <p> I manage and direct a team of four junior instructors on how to teach our introductory programming class effectively. I teach my own section of the course to 4-5 students and utilize unique feedback-based system for improving course content. I also work with course staff to design supplemental worksheets, film exam walkthroughs, and establish curriculum. The difference between the mentor program and course staff is that mentoring is catered to smaller groups and those who require additional assistance beyond what is taught in lecture and discussion.</p>
                </br>

                    <h3>Accel Scholar, <a href="https://eecs.berkeley.edu/resources/undergrads/accel" target="_blank">Accel</a></h3>
                    <p>I was one of thirty students selected from a pool of over 500 as an Accel Scholar. The program was designed as a unique mentorship program for entrepreneurial minded students to be able to cultivate a strong network of talented professionals and explore new opportunities under the watchful eye of seasoned veterans in the space through Accel, an established venture capital firm.</p>
                    </br>

                    <h3>Events and Programming Committee Member, <a href="https://berkeleyforum.org/meet-our-team/" target="_blank">The Berkeley Forum</a></h3>
                    <p>The Berkeley Forum is a student-run organization at the University of California, Berkeley. Established in 2012, the Forum hosts debates, panels, and talks by leading experts from a wide variety of fields. Since our founding, we have worked to provide a non-partisan and accessible forum that hosts a wide range of ideas‚Äîa unique opportunity for the campus and community to engage with novel perspectives and experiences. From politics (Senator Rand Paul, Secretary Julian Castro, Governor Martin O‚ÄôMalley) to tech (Project Include CEO and former Reddit CEO Ellen Pao, Craigslist founder Craig Newmark), to academia (Turing Award winner Vint Cerf, Broad Institute investigator Feng Zhang), our events have covered a broad array of topics. Our hope is that they provoke discussion and continue to shape the culture of discourse at Berkeley. I was personally on the committee that invites new speakers and stages events, including managing logistics and venues as well as catering to speaker needs.</p>

                    <h2>What I've Done</h2>
                    <hr>

                    <h3>Software Engineering Intern, <a href="https://www.coursera.org" target="_blank">Coursera</a></h3>
                    <p>I worked on the infrastructure team at Coursera as an intern, specifically on the data services workstream. I improved upon the Nostos service, an offline-to-online data cache, by crafting a pipeline from Redshift to S3 to AWS Aurora MySQL written using Scala, Java, and SQL and then reconfiguring the Nostos backend (once again using Scala) to specifically access the new MySQL stores. I configured the new SQL solution from scratch by spinning up Aurora clusters, tuning configurations, and setting up parameter and security groups as well as setting up permissions for S3. I was one of the first testers of Amazon Aurora Postgres 2.0 in a production setting and I realized it was not the best (sorry Amazon). Three bug reports later, I switched to Aurora MySQL and was able to complete the project. There were a few improvements from the previous Cassandra solution but the main feature is that it allowed Coursera to deprecate its Cassandra usage since there were no longer any experts in Cassandra left at the company.</p>

                    <h3>Kleiner Perkins Fellow, <a href="http://fellows.kleinerperkins.com/meet-the-fellows" target="_blank">Kleiner Perkins</a></h3>
                    <p>1 of 50 engineering fellows selected from over 3000 applicants. Named the #2 summer internship program by Vault (out of over 400 programs), the KP Fellows Program is an intensive, high-impact summer program for students pursuing careers in engineering, design, and product. In addition to completing an internship at a company within the KP portfolio, fellows attend events held by Kleiner Perkins and various portfolio companies.</p>

                    <h3>Juni Learning, <a href="https://junilearning.com" target="_blank">Instructor, Software Engineering Intern</a></h3>

                    <p>I taught high school students advanced web design with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, data analysis with Python, and software design principles with Java. I also developed an interactive sandbox web app (Java server with Spring MVC) as a tool to teach students about memory management in C.</p>
                    </br>

                    <h2>What I've Written</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>I like to write quick essays on ideas that pass my fancy, ranging from <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CpSjBsiCsy8OXtQSDuW0MoBy7uZzsZfm6FIPsUOYVhE/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">cultural relativism</a> to <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FMPa2peYLiRtw4-LcKlB8xH3FE6CULGH200T3uPdizI/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">industrial capitalism</a>. While most of my pieces are private, I would like to start publishing in established <a href="https://www.medium.com" target="_blank">medium</a>s soon (pun intended). Also, <a href="mailto:scherfaoui@berkeley.edu" target="_blank">feel free to drop me a line</a> if you'd like me to research something for you or you'd like me to whip up a literature review. I absolutely love learning about completely disparate topics and there is no better way to do that than authoring a literature review.</p>
                    </br>

                    <h2>What I've Built</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Quick note: I am pretty much almost always working on a new side project, though I like to keep the projects on the low until I actually release them. I am currently working on a peer-to-peer mutual learning platform and also creating a Google Maps directional platform that gives scenic routes rather than the quickest routes. If you'd like to learn more about these projects or get updated when I finish or release them, <a href="mailto:scherfaoui@berkeley.edu" target="_blank">feel free to drop me a line</a>.</p>

                    </h3>
                    <p>AutoMatminer is an automatic prediction engine for materials properties that I worked on with Alex Dunn, Alex Ganose, Qi Wang, and Dr. Anubhav Jain. I also contributed significantly to the documentation.</p>
                    </br>

                    <h3>Port Authority
                        <a href="https://github.com/samysspace/PortAuthority" target="_blank"><i class="fab fa-1x fa-github" style="margin-right: 2px;"></i></a>
                    </h3>
                    <p>PortAuthority is a simple network utility made with Flask that allows you to input an IP address or domain and range of ports, and get back the ports that are open within that range at that address. Think Nmap except without all the bells and whistles. Currently at 12 stars on Github.</p>
                    </br>

                    <h3>Throwaway 
                        <a href="https://github.com/samysspace/Throwaway" target="_blank"><i class="fab fa-1x fa-github" style="margin-right: 2px;"></i></a>
                    </h3>
                    <p>This simple Flask web app will assign a user a temporary email address which they can use as they wish to sign up for accounts, get rewards etc. I built a Python API wrapper for the Temp Mail API and a simple and flexible web interface to see the emails.</p>
                    </br>

                    <h3>Flexfill
                        <a href="https://github.com/samysspace/flexfill" target="_blank"><i class="fab fa-1x fa-github" style="margin-right: 2px;"></i></a>
                    </h3>
                    <p>Have you ever had trouble adding event handlers for antiquated browsers? Confused about what functions to call to establish polyfill functionality? Well, look no further than flexfill! Flexfill is a want-all catch-all event handler mechanism which does the grunt work for you so you don't need to worry about adding specialized functionality for those dang users who are still using IE6.</p>
